📊 Data Profiling and Analysis: I profiled and analyzed the dataset using the data profiling and analysis functionalities in Tableau to get a deep understanding of what this dataset contains and what it does not.

🔗 Data Connect and Prep: I performed an inner join on multiple tables to guarantee that the quality and optimization of the data were maintained with Tableau when connecting and preparing the data.

🎨 Creation of Visualizations: Using the drag-and-drop functionality in Tableau, I created a series of interactive visualizations that highlighted informative patterns and trends.

📈 Aggregation and Calculation: I leveraged Tableau's calculation and aggregation functionalities to examine how the number of bedrooms impacts rents, providing valuable insight into investment decisions.

🖥️ Dashboard Design: I've designed a very in-depth analysis of a dashboard layout that clearly conveys my findings. I will ensure with Tableau's dashboard layout and publishing features that these insights are easy to access and view.

📝 Final thoughts: This was a Tableau project for analyzing rental markets by using Airbnb listings, which showed amazing trends in the prices of rentals. Following data analysis and visualization, I developed an easy-to-use dashboard that communicates key insights to investors and stakeholders. The experience accorded me the capability to understand data and present it in a format that is easy to digest.
